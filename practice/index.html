<h2 >Thailand sees growing influx of patients from Bangladesh
</h2>
<p>
    Bangladeshi patients searching for better healthcare than that available at home are increasingly travelling to Thailand instead of India as the neighbouring country is limiting visa issuances for Bangladeshi nationals.

    Besides, the compassionate attitudes shown by hospital staff in Thailand coupled with its easy e-visa application process are propelling the influx of patients from Bangladesh to the east Asian nation.</p>

    <h2>It's unreal, it's been an amazing series: Cummins
    </h2>

   <p>Australia held their nerve to chase down their victory target of 162 after lunch on the third day of the fifth Test on Sunday, beating India by six wickets for a 3-1 series win and reclaiming the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the first time in a decade.

    Travis Head, who was 34 not out, and debutant Beau Webster, unbeaten on 39, got Australia over the line to also secure the hosts a spot in the World Test Championship final against South Africa at Lord's in June.
    
    "I feel privileged to have this job and what we have been able to achieve together. Pretty satisfied at the moment."
    
    
    The match had been played on fast forward over the first two days with 15 wickets falling on Saturday, and Australia removed four more in the first hour on Sunday morning to dismiss India for 157.

    The track retained some spice, and Krishna stood up in Bumrah's stead and sent back opener Sam Konstas for 22, Marnus Labuschagne for six and Steve Smith for four before lunch.

    <h2>Henry, Young power New Zealand to nine-wicket ODI win over Sri Lanka
    </h2>
    <img src="image/will_young.jpg" alt="">

    <p>Matt Henry claimed four wickets and Will Young scored an unbeaten 90 Sunday as New Zealand coasted to a nine-wicket win over Sri Lanka in the first one-day international.

        The tourists never recovered after slumping to 23-4 inside 10 overs, dismissed in the 44th over for 178 after being asked to bat in Wellington.
        
        In response, Young was barely flustered during a fluent 86-ball knock, putting on 93 for the opening stand with Rachin Ravindra, who scored 45.
        
        Mark Chapman was not out 29 as the home side reached the target from 26.2 overs in an emphatic start to the three-match series.
        
        Coming off a productive Test series against England, Henry was a handful with the new ball in seam-friendly conditions, taking the key wicket of opener Pathum Nissanka for nine in the fifth over.
        
        The relentless seamer returned to help mop up the tail, finishing with 4-19 off 10 overs.</p>
